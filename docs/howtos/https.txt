How to run HTTPS server?

1. Configure SSL by setting "port" and "ssl" server properties in cricket.json as follows:

"properties": {
    "host": "0.0.0.0",
    "port": "443",
    "ssl": "true",
    "keystore": "./data/cricket_publickeystore.jks",
    "keystore-password": "cricket15$#17",
    "threads": "0",
    "filter": "org.cricketmsf.SecurityFilter",
    "cors": "Access-Control-Allow-Origin:*",
    "time-zone": "GMT",
    "SRVC_NAME_ENV_VARIABLE": "CRICKET_NAME"
}

When you set "ssl":"false" the "keystore" and "keystore-password" will be ignored.

The default keystore with the self signed certificate for "localhost" is generated 
during building Cricket distribution with
"ant dist" command.
