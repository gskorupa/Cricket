Cricket service behavior can be tuned by two OS environment variables:

1. CMF_PARAM
Acts same as -f command line option (overwrites -f option)

2. CRICKET_NAME
Can be used to set the service name. Defaults to "CricketService"

The name of this enironment variable can be configured in cricket.jason.
Example:
...
"@type": "org.cricketmsf.config.Configuration",
"id": "echo",
"service": "org.cricketmsf.services.BasicService",
"properties": {
    "host": "0.0.0.0",
    "port": "8080",
    "threads": "0",
    "filter": "org.cricketmsf.SecurityFilter",
    "cors": "Access-Control-Allow-Origin:*",
    "time-zone": "GMT",
    "SRVC_NAME_ENV_VARIABLE": "CRICKET_NAME"
}
...
