# Cricket framework for microservices development

## 1. Prerequisities

Before starting development you need to install:

* Java 7
* Apache Ant
* Apache Tomcat 

Apache Tomcat is needed to compile http interface

## 2. Developing standalone application

### 2.1 Create the Bookshelf service

clone Cricket project from Github
copy template/standalone subfolder to location of your choice
create project in Netbeans (see detailde description in next chapters)
edit build.xml

At this point you should be able to build your application by executing Ant target dist

ant dist

and run it by executing

java -jar bookshelf-1.0.0.jar

The application should print a welcome message and quit. So you just have compiled, packed and run the basic service. Not very usable but working.
Now lets start a real development.

### 2.2 Business analysis

### 2.3 REST API design

### 2.4 Component design

#### 2.2.1 BookshelfService

#### 2.2.2 Book database



### 2.5 The Code

### 2.6 Changing service adapters

Lets say that the project sponsor decided to change database implementation from actual flat file to relational database.
